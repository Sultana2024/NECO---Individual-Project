# NECO---Individual-Project

**Individual project (75 marks):**

- organization and clarity of Python code with comments (5 marks)
- appropriate use and sophistication of methods’ implementation (10 marks)
- brief summary of the two methods with their pros and cons and hypothesis statement (5 marks)
- description of the choice of training and evaluation methodology e.g. cross-validation, choice of parameters and experimental results (5 marks)
- analysis and critical evaluation of results, consider both the merits and limitations of your analysis, it is important that the evaluation is fair, accurate and do not overstate the findings (20 marks)
- references, lessons learned and future work (5 marks)
- glossary and intermediate results including any negative results (5 marks)
- implementation details with main implementation choices (5 marks)
- explanation of the implementation work and the code in the video (10 marks)
- overall clarity of presentation (5 marks)


**Deliverables **

1. All the source code and test data set (as a single zip file) + in zip file a readme.txt file with any instructions on how your models should be run
2. A paper (in pdf format, single column, font Arial 11, maximum 6 pages including all figures and references) containing a description of your experiments and comparative critical evaluation of results. At least two figures which graphically illustrate quantitative aspects of your results, such as training/testing error curves, etc. 
3. The paper’s supplementary material (maximum 2 pages) containing a glossary and any relevant intermediate results or implementation details. 
4. A 5 to 10-minute video showing you presenting your paper and code (as a single .mp4 file). Do not exceed 10 minutes. Following a brief introduction to the task and data set, your video should focus on explaining the implementation work and your code: comment on the main blocks of your code including the training of the models, demonstrate a run of your code on the training set and the test set. Conclude by summarising your main findings and lessons learned: what went wrong and how you addressed the challenges that you’ve encountered, the results that you’re most proud of, and what you would have done differently.
5. A print-out (as a single pdf file) of your entire code. Make sure to add comments to the code describing briefly the purpose of each function.
